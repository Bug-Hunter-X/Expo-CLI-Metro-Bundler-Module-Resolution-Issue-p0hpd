The solution involves two steps:

1. Clearing the Metro bundler cache:
   This step helps in resolving issues arising due to stale cache entries.
   You can clear the cache by running `expo prebuild --clean` before starting the app.

2. Verify module paths:
   Double-check that your module imports are using the correct relative or absolute paths. If using a library with complex structure, ensure the library's documentation correctly guides the import statements.  Consider using absolute imports to mitigate path resolution issues in the Expo environment.
